Our group used methane gas emissions data for 1990-2012 years from the World Bank to create a dashboard that visualizes methane gas produced by Top 10 countries.  We also used data for 1990-2012 years from the OECD to visualize the amount of beef consumed by each country per capita.  We then linked beef consumption with methane gas emissions in an effort to tell a story about how beef consumption impacts methane gas emissions.
